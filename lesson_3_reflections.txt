When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this in any situation where I was working with other people on a project,
or where we were not all located in the same geographical location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would only want to pull or push changes when I felt I was ready.. i.e. with a working prototype 
or something worth sharing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

Branch is a change within a local directory, a clone is a copy from GitHub to local, and a 
fork is a clone within GitHub (i.e. one user to another)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Seems like you want to have a copy in case anyone else made changes at the 'GitHub' level.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Used Content Management systems with version control but always always 
always something goes missing. Sharing files on a drive is also madness... Go with something like Git 
if you need good versioning control

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What 
benefits does each approach have?

I would almost always want to work on a branch for any new featues, specifically if I'm collaborating.
It's nice to have a 'master' copy that hasnt been touched if you need to rever back to it.
