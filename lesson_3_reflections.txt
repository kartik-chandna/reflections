When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this in any situation where I was working with other people on a project,
or where we were not all located in the same geographical location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would only want to pull or push changes when I felt I was ready.. i.e. with a working prototype 
or something worth sharing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

Branch is a change within a local directory, a clone is a copy from GitHub to local, and a 
fork is a clone within GitHub (i.e. one user to another)
