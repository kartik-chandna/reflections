What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		
	A new git repository is created which we can used to track changes in the file of that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	in staging area, we had not committed our work. It makes us more error prone so that we don't anything useless in the repository by mistake.
