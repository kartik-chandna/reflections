How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was actually pretty amazing. I had seen the git and version control videos in treehouse,
but actually 'seeing' how it + (plused) and - (minused) any changes was super easy.

I can see how with lines and lines of code, you would want to focus in only on the changes in 
the last version.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer 
in the long term?

You can easily go back and see the changes, be aware of prgressions and almost see what people were
'thinking' as the new file developed.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do 
in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: Complete control. People seem to love autonomy, and this satisies that need.
Cons: People like me can be unfocused and get lazy or caught up in a hting and not commit as 
frequently as they should. And there is nothing in the system that 'forces' this, so there is an 
obvious danger there...


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

My feelig on this is all about what the files represent. Google Docs likley deals with separate files 
like essays and 'instructions' or something similar in content, while Git deals with code, which could 
include multiple files all working together.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to see what changes were logged, and then compare between changes using git diff and 
file_id1 and file_id2


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If I am confident that all changes (within the scope of any one commit) ae captured and can be compared, 
then I should be confident enough to make changes and not be so worried about tracking them, since Git 
is doing it for me!!


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

It would be good practice to use it for all coding changes, HTML pages and other exercises I end up 
working on, going forward...
